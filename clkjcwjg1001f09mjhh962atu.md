## ☁️What is Cloud Computing? 🤔

### 🌐Definition:

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources such as computing power, database, storage, and applications over the Internet without the need for physical infrastructure.

### 💻Types:

There are three primary cloud computing models:

* **Public Cloud:** Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider offered to multiple clients over the Internet.
    
* **Private Cloud:** Cloud services are used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
    
* **Hybrid Cloud:** A combination of public and private clouds. Keep some servers on-premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
    

### 📁Services:

Cloud computing provides a wide range of services like

* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
    
    • Provide building blocks for cloud IT
    
    • Provides networking, computers, data storage space
    
    • Highest level of flexibility
    
    • Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
    
    For example Amazon EC2
    
* **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
    
    • Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
    
    • Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
    
    For example Elastic BeanStalk
    
* **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
    
    • Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
    
    For example Rekognition
    

# ☁️What is AWS?🤔
